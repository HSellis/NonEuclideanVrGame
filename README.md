# Non-Euclidean Space in Virtual Reality

NonEuclideanVRGame is a VR puzzle game where the player has to explore the surrounding non-Euclidean environment to progress the game. The game uses room-scale VR, meaning the player can move around freely, just like in real life.

The requirement for the play area size is 3m x 3m but through clever use of non-Euclidean space, the player can freely move around 80+ m<sup>2</sup> in the game.
